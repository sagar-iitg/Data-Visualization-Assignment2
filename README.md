# Data-Visualization-Assignment2

outline <br>
Often a tabular data has implicit grouping, for example a data giving several financial
statistics of the last 5 years for all states in India. Now the respective two columns are
state names and years. If we want to visualize one particular attribute over the five years
for each state in a single plot, without creating another data, we have to use the concept of
grouping. <br>

Similarly, if we want to visualize one particular attribute for each state separately but
keeping those plots next to each other or in a grid fashion, then we have to use the concept
of faceting.<br>

Introduce two concepts while summarizing and visualizing a tabular data: Grouping
and Faceting.<br>
